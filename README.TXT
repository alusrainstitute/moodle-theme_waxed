THEME_WAXED
===========

Theme_Waxed is a child theme of Moodle's new core theme Boost.

It is built on Boostrap4 and Mustache templates.

In addition to Boost's preset settings, Wax adds:

1. Presets - presets added by ftp/ssh to the theme/scss/presets folder will
be automatically added to the presets drop down, in addition to those uploaded
via the user interface.
2. Colours - additional brad colour pickers to fine tune the seleected presets,
along with the standard pre/post raw scss custom settings.
3. Content - a footnote setting to add standard content into the footer space
4. Heading and images - add a page background image and a default heading background
image - the heading image can be overridden at a course level by adding an image
banner to the course summary files. A separate login page background image can also
be added.
5. Social networking icons - a panel of social icons can be created, including self-
defined icons.

Waxed is intended to be the stable release version of development work and
experimentation being carried out in theme_stagetwo. So if you would like to
make suggestions for further development or improvements, feel free to contact
me through https://github.com/roelmann and see any testing and development being
carried out on stagetwo prior to release here on theme_waxed.
